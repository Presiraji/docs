<h5>â‹® App menu</h5>

Streamlit provides a configurable menu within your app to access convenient tools for developers and viewers. These options can modify the appearance of your app while running.

- [Modify your app's theme while running](/develop/concepts/elements-and-ui/app-menu#settings)
- [Record a screencast of your app](/develop/concepts/elements-and-ui/app-menu#record-a-screencast)
- [Deploy a local app to Streamlit Community Cloud](/develop/concepts/elements-and-ui/app-menu#deploy-this-app)
- [Customize or hide the app menu](/develop/concepts/elements-and-ui/app-menu#customize-the-menu)

<RefCard href="/develop/concepts/configuration/cli" size="half">

<h5>Command-line options</h5>

When you install Streamlit, a command-line (CLI) tool gets installed as well. The purpose of this tool is to run Streamlit apps, change Streamlit configuration options, and help you diagnose and fix issues.

- [What is the command-line interface (CLI)?](/develop/concepts/configuration/cli#command-line-interface)
- [How to run Streamlit apps from the CLI?](/develop/concepts/configuration/cli#run-streamlit-apps)
- [View Streamlit version from the CLI?](/develop/concepts/configuration/cli#view-streamlit-version)
- [View documentation from the CLI](/develop/concepts/configuration/cli#view-documentation)
- [Clear cache from the CLI](/develop/concepts/configuration/cli#clear-cache)

<RefCard href="/develop/concepts/caching" size="half">

<h5>Caching</h5>

The Streamlit cache allows your app to stay performant even when loading data from the web, manipulating large datasets, or performing expensive computations. To cache a function in Streamlit, you need to decorate it with one of two decorators: `st.cache_data` and `st.cache_resource`.

- [Minimal example](/develop/concepts/caching#minimal-example)
- [Basic usage](/develop/concepts/caching#basic-usage)
  - [st.cache_data](/develop/concepts/caching#stcache_data)
  - [st.cache_resource](/develop/concepts/caching#stcache_resource)
  - [Deciding which caching decorator to use](/develop/concepts/caching#deciding-which-caching-decorator-to-use)
- [Advanced usage](/develop/concepts/caching#advanced-usage)
  - [Excluding input parameters](/develop/concepts/caching#excluding-input-parameters)
  - [Controlling cache size and duration](/develop/concepts/caching#controlling-cache-size-and-duration)

<RefCard href="/develop/concepts/session-state" size="half">

<h5>Add statefulness to apps</h5>

Session State is a way to share variables between reruns, for each user session. In addition to the ability to store and persist state, Streamlit also exposes the ability to manipulate state using Callbacks.
